UI/UX Enhancements
✅ Better Slot Selection Experience

Instead of just displaying slots as a list, I would make them clickable buttons that users can select instead of using a dropdown.
Add a disabled state for booked slots and highlight the selected slot.
✅ Date Picker Integration

Use a calendar-style date picker (like react-datepicker) instead of a text input for selecting dates.
Disable past dates and allow users to see available slots dynamically.
✅ Loader/Spinner for a Smooth Experience

While loading slots, a spinner or "Loading available slots..." text should be shown instead of an empty list.
✅ Success Message or Toast Notification

Instead of using alert('Appointment booked!'), use a toast notification (react-toastify) for better feedback.
✅ Mobile-Friendly UI

Ensure the form is fully responsive and adapts well on mobile screens.

2️⃣ Performance & Code Improvements
✅ Avoid useEffect for State Updates

generateSlots() depends on appointments, but useEffect doesn’t re-run when appointments change.
I would call generateSlots() inside saveAppointments() after booking an appointment to ensure the UI updates immediately.
✅ Reduce LocalStorage Calls

Instead of reading from localStorage on every render, store appointments in state and sync it only when needed.
✅ Optimize useState Calls

Store appointments in a useRef and update it only when needed instead of re-rendering the component on every change.
✅ Use TypeScript Properly

Replace any[] type with a proper interface for appointments.
Define proper types for handleInputChange and handleSubmit to avoid implicit any types.
3️⃣ Additional Features
✅ Cancel or Reschedule Appointments

Allow users to cancel or reschedule existing appointments.
Show booked appointments in a list with a "Cancel" button.
✅ Dark Mode Support

Add a light/dark mode toggle for better accessibility.
✅ Backend Integration (Optional for Real Use Case)

Instead of using localStorage, I would store appointments in a backend API using Node.js + Express or Firebase.
✅ Authentication for Returning Users

Allow users to log in so they can see their past and upcoming appointments.
Use Google OAuth or email-based authentication.
